This folder needs real images to display properly. 

For development, you can use placeholder images from:
1. https://placeholder.com 
2. https://picsum.photos
3. Or create your own placeholders

Required images:
- /images/hero-bg.jpg (large background for hero section)
- /images/featured/*.jpg (large images for featured section)
- /images/categories/*.jpg (small icons for categories)
- /images/recipes/*.jpg (medium images for recipe cards)
- /images/authors/*.jpg (small avatars for authors)

For a production site, replace these with optimized images.
